# Fusion MCP Integration

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46c8140e-377d-4618-a304-03861cb3d7d9

## 🎯 About

Fusion MCP Integration bridges AI assistants with Autodesk Fusion 360 through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This enables:

- ✨ **Conversational CAD** - Create 3D models using natural language
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Automation** - Automate repetitive modeling tasks
- 🔧 **Parametric Control** - Dynamically modify design parameters
- 🎓 **Accessible CAD** - Lower the barrier for non-CAD users
- 🎨 **Complex Models** - Create prop replicas, custom enclosures, and functional designs

> **Note:** This is designed as an assistive tool and educational project, not a replacement for professional CAD workflows.
> Projects like this can assist people with no experience in CAD workflows.

> **Goal:** Enable conversational CAD and AI-driven automation in Fusion.

> **⚠️ Important:** See [Known Limitations](./KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for workflow constraints and best practices.

# Setup

**I highly recommend to do everything inside Visual Studio Code or an other IDE**

---

## Requirements

| Requirement         | Link                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Python 3.10+        | https://python.org             |
| Autodesk Fusion 360 | https://autodesk.com/fusion360 |
| Claude Desktop      | https://claude.ai/download     |
| VS Code             | https://code.visualstudio.com  |

---

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustusBraitinger/FusionMCP
```

> **Important:** Do **NOT** start the Add-In yet.

## Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd Server
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate venv

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

### Install packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

## Installing the MCP Add-In for Fusion 360

```bash
cd ..
python Install_Addin.py
```

---

## Connect to Claude

The most simple way to add the MCP-Server to Claude Desktop is to run following command:

```bash
cd Server
uv run mcp install MCP_Server.py
```

The output should be like this:

```bash
[11/13/25 08:42:37] INFO     Added server 'Fusion' to Claude config
                    INFO     Successfully installed Fusion in Claude app
```

# Alternative

### Modify Claude Config

In Claude Desktop go to:
**Settings → Developer → Edit Config**

Add this block (change the path for your system):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FusionMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Path\\to\\FusionMCP\\Server",
        "run",
        "MCP_Server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Windows paths require double backslashes `\\`

### Using the MCP in Claude

1. Restart Claude if needed (force close if not visible)
2. Click **➕ Add** (bottom left of chat)
3. Select **Add from Fusion**
4. Choose a Fusion MCP prompt

---

## Use MCP in VS Code (Copilot)

Create or edit the file:

```
%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\github.copilot-chat\mcp.json
```

Paste:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "FusionMCP": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse",
      "type": "http"
    }
  },
  "inputs": []
}
```

### Alternative Setup in VS Code

1. Press **CTRL + SHIFT + P** → search **MCP** → choose:
2. **Add MCP**
3. **HTTP**
4. Enter:
5. Name your MCP **`FusionMCP`**!!

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse
```

---

## Try It Out 😄

Activate the Fusion Addin inside Fusion

### Configured in VS-Code:

Start the server:

```bash
python MCP_Server.py
```

Then type

```
/mcp.FusionMCP
```

Now you will see a list of predetermined Prompts.

### Configured in Claude

Just open Claude, an ask for the FusionMCP

## 🚀 New Advanced Features

These tools address limitations in multi-face feature creation and complex parametric relationships:

### ✨ Face-Based Modeling

- **Sketch on Face**: Create sketches directly on angled faces (no more floating geometry!)
- **Pocket/Recess**: Cut depressions into bodies with precise depth control
- **Project Edges**: Reference existing body edges in your sketches for accurate alignment

### 📐 Construction Aids

- **Work Planes**: Create offset reference planes from bodies or standard planes
- **Polygon Tool**: Draw perfect hexagons, octagons, and other regular polygons
- **Mirror Feature**: Create symmetric features across planes

### 🎯 Surface Operations

- **Offset Surface**: Create parallel surfaces for wall thicknesses
- **Advanced Extrude**: Use taper angles for beveled surfaces (via `extrude` with `angle` parameter)

### Example Workflow: Creating Panel Recesses

```python
# 1. Create main body
draw_box(height=10, width=10, depth=2, x=0, y=0, z=0)

# 2. Create sketch on top face
sketch_on_face(body_index=-1, face_index=4)

# 3. Draw hexagon for recess
draw_polygon(sides=6, radius=3, x=0, y=0, z=0, plane="XY")

# 4. Create pocket
pocket_recess(depth=0.5)

# 5. Mirror for symmetric design
mirror_feature(mirror_plane="XY")
```

## Architecture

### Server.py

- Defines MCP server, tools, and prompts
- Handles HTTP calls to Fusion add-in

### MCP.py

- Fusion Add-in
- Because the Fusion API is not thread-safe, this uses:
  - Custom event handler
  - Task queue

---

### Why This Architecture?

The Fusion 360 API is **not thread-safe** and requires all operations to run on the main UI thread. Our solution:

1. **Event-Driven Design** - Use Fusion's CustomEvent system
2. **Task Queue** - Queue operations for sequential execution
3. **Async Bridge** - HTTP server handles async MCP requests

### Known Limitations

The integration has some workflow constraints due to Fusion API behavior:

- Face topology changes after boolean operations (pockets, cuts)
- Sketch re-creation limitations on same faces
- Timing constraints for rapid-fire operations

**See [Known Limitations](./KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for details and workarounds.**

## Security Considerations 🔒

- Local execution → safe by default
- Currently HTTP (OK locally, insecure on networks)
- Validate tool inputs to avoid prompt injection
- Real security depends on tool implementation

---

### This is NOT

- ❌ A production-ready tool
- ❌ A replacement for professional CAD software
- ❌ Suitable for critical engineering work
- ❌ Officially supported by Autodesk

### This IS

- ✅ A proof-of-concept
- ✅ An educational project
- ✅ A demonstration of MCP capabilities
- ✅ A tool for rapid prototyping and learning

---

**This is a proof-of-concept, not production software.**

# Note

I did not know about script generation MCP workflows, because I am pretty new to this Software world
If you want to build it yourself i suggest you look into that concept
